    question: "How much does bathtub removal cost in Chandler?",
    answer: "Bathtub removal in Chandler typically costs $300-$1,000 depending on tub type, accessibility, and disposal needs. Cast iron tubs cost more to remove due to weight. Our quotes include removal, hauling, and basic floor preparation."
  },
  {
    question: "How long does tub removal take?",
    answer: "Most bathtub removals are completed in 2-4 hours. Cast iron tubs may take longer due to their weight. We disconnect plumbing, remove the tub, and prepare the area for your next project phase."
  },
  {
    question: "Do you cap the plumbing after tub removal?",
    answer: "Yes! We properly cap all plumbing lines after tub removal to prevent water damage. If you're converting to a shower, we can prepare the plumbing for your new installation."
  },
  {
    question: "What happens to the floor after tub removal?",
    answer: "After removing the tub, we inspect and repair the subfloor as needed. We can prepare the surface for tile, shower pan installation, or whatever your renovation requires."
  }
